~Description:

In this Codtech internship task, I focused on **predictive analysis using machine learning models** to classify survival outcomes based on the famous Titanic dataset. The primary objective was to build, train, and evaluate a classification model that could predict whether a passenger survived based on their characteristics such as age, sex, class, fare, and more.

I began the task by **importing necessary Python libraries** including pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, and scikit-learn. Then, I loaded the Titanic dataset from Seaborn’s built-in library for convenience and performed **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to understand the data types, missing values, and overall dataset structure. I observed that columns like 'deck' and 'embark_town' had significant missing data, hence I dropped them to maintain dataset quality.

Next, I conducted **data preprocessing** by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables using Label Encoding, and selecting relevant features for model training. The target variable for this task was 'survived', a binary classification problem.

For model building, I used **two machine learning algorithms**:
1. **Logistic Regression** – a linear model suitable for binary classification tasks.  
2. **Random Forest Classifier** – an ensemble model that combines multiple decision trees for improved performance.

I split the dataset into training and testing sets with an 80-20 ratio to evaluate model generalizability. Both models were trained, and their performances were evaluated using metrics such as **accuracy score, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix**.

The results indicated that while **Logistic Regression performed decently**, **Random Forest achieved higher accuracy and balanced classification metrics**, making it more robust for this dataset. I also visualized the confusion matrix for the Random Forest model using Seaborn heatmap for clear interpretation of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.

Overall, this task enhanced my understanding of **supervised machine learning workflow**, from dataset preparation to model evaluation. It demonstrated how classification models can be used for predictive analysis in real-world business contexts like passenger survival analysis, customer churn prediction, or medical diagnosis. I ensured proper commenting and modular code writing to maintain readability and industry standards.

Through this task, I strengthened my ability to handle **classification problems, feature engineering, and interpreting model evaluation metrics** effectively. This practical exposure will help me build more complex models confidently in upcoming tasks and professional projects.
